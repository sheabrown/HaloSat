# HaloSat
Survey strategy software for the HaloSat X-ray satellite. Below is the output of test_observe.py, which uses the getObsWindow() function to find the Sun's antipodal point on a given date and plot the allowed observing window (against, in this case, a Fermi gamma-ray map).

The radius of the allowed observing window in this case was set to 20 degrees.
